# Contributing to CouchDB Documentation

Patches are very welcome.

To build the documentation locally, run `make`.  You will need to have `sphinx-build` installed - on Debian/Ubuntu systems, this can be found in the package ``python-sphinx``.

Before submitting a patch, run `make check` to ensure that syntax is as it should be.
